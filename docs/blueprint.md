# **App Name**: ScrollMotion

## Core Features:

- Media Expansion on Scroll: Expands a media element (video or image) as the user scrolls down the page, creating an immersive effect.
- Dynamic Text Reveal: Reveals title text dynamically using translateX, creating a parallax-like effect.
- Content Display: Displays additional content after the media is fully expanded.
- Responsive Design: Adjusts media expansion and text translate based on screen size to accommodate mobile and desktop devices.
- Background Image with Opacity Transition: Displayes a background image behind the expanding media, and includes a smooth transition effect.
- Media Type Handling: Supports both video (including YouTube embeds) and images as the primary media, adjusting display properties accordingly.
- Scroll Lock: Locks the scroll until media is expanded, then allows user to continue down the page. A tool prevents user scrolling during the image loading process, enhancing UX by preventing scroll glitches

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Soft blue (#A0C4FF) to create a calm and immersive feel.
- Background color: Very light blue (#F0F8FF) to complement the primary color and create a clean look.
- Accent color: Light orange (#FFB347) to highlight interactive elements and call to action.

- Full-screen layout with centered content to maximize the immersive experience.
- Smooth transitions and subtle animations to enhance the scrolling experience.
